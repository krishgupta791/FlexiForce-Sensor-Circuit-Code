This repository contains the Teensy 4.1 firmware and MATLAB scripts used to collect, stream, and analyze voltage outputs from a FlexiForce force 
sensor through an amplifier circuit. All wiring instructions, hardware photos, procedures, and experimental steps are documented in the included 
FlexiForce Circuit Experiment SOP. The code in this repository supports live serial data acquisition, visualization, and calibration for force–voltage 
characterization.
